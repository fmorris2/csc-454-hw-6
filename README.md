# CSC-454 HW6

Reimplement your discrete event simulation framework in C++. Use all tools the language provides for you, such as templates and data structures in the std namespace. Be careful what data structure you use for the event schedule.

After you are done with the framework, reimplement the discrete event network model from HW5 in it. In addition, implement a discrete event version of the network models in HW3 by adding a time advance function to all atomic models. The time advance for any state is going to be 1.0 .

In addition, take a careful look at your Java framework. Is it sufficiently abstract? Are you using generics? What design patterns would fit it well? Make it perfect for this homework.
